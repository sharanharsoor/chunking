            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every task.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed." - Andrew Ng

            <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: Learning with labeled data</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: Finding patterns in unlabeled data</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Learning through interaction and feedback</li>

            <h2>Implementation Example</h2>
            <p>Here's a simple example of implementing a linear regression model using Python:</p>

            <pre><code class="python">
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.randn(100, 1)
y = 2 * X.flatten() + 1 + np.random.randn(100) * 0.1

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Model coefficient: {model.coef_[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Model intercept: {model.intercept_:.2f}")
