## Neural Network Architectures
Deep neural networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes. Each layer performs transformations on the input data, learning increasingly complex representations. Modern architectures like transformers use attention mechanisms to process sequences efficiently.

## Training Optimization
Gradient descent optimization algorithms update model parameters iteratively. Adam optimizer adapts learning rates for each parameter individually. Batch normalization stabilizes training by normalizing layer inputs.

## Regularization Techniques
Dropout randomly sets neuron outputs to zero during training to prevent overfitting. L1 and L2 regularization add penalty terms to the loss function. Early stopping prevents overfitting by monitoring validation performance.

## Performance Evaluation
Cross-validation provides robust performance estimates by training on multiple data splits. Precision and recall measure classification performance for imbalanced datasets. ROC curves visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
