# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction to Neural Networks
Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks.
They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections.
Deep learning utilizes multiple layers of neurons to learn complex patterns in data.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training models on labeled datasets where input-output pairs are known.
Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
The goal is to generalize from training data to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.
Clustering algorithms group similar data points together.
Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA compress data while preserving important information.

## Natural Language Processing
NLP enables computers to understand and process human language.
Tokenization breaks text into smaller units like words or subwords.
Language models learn statistical patterns in text to generate coherent responses.

## Computer Vision
Computer vision allows machines to interpret and understand visual information.
Convolutional neural networks excel at recognizing patterns in images.
Object detection combines classification with spatial localization of objects.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning trains agents to make decisions through trial and error.
Agents receive rewards or penalties based on their actions in an environment.
Q-learning and policy gradient methods are popular reinforcement learning approaches.
