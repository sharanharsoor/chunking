Streaming Benefits Demo

This demo showcases the advantages of streaming support in the chunking library.
Demonstrates:
- Memory-efficient processing of large files
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Checkpoint and resume functionality
- Performance comparisons: streaming vs. traditional loading
- Streaming with different chunking strategies
- Monitoring and progress tracking

Essential for processing large documents, continuous data streams, and memory-constrained environments.
