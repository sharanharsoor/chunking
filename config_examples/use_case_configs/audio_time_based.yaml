# Audio Time-Based Chunking Configuration
# Simple configuration for time-based audio chunking

profile_name: "audio_time_based"
description: "Time-based audio chunking with configurable segment duration and overlap"

chunking:
  # Use time_based_audio as default for all files
  default_strategy: "time_based_audio"

  # Map specific audio file extensions to time_based_audio strategy
  strategy_selection:
    ".mp3": "time_based_audio"
    ".wav": "time_based_audio"
    ".ogg": "time_based_audio"
    ".flac": "time_based_audio"
    ".m4a": "time_based_audio"
    ".aac": "time_based_audio"

  # Configure time_based_audio chunker parameters
  strategy_params:
    time_based_audio:
      segment_duration: 30.0        # 30-second segments
      overlap_duration: 2.0         # 2-second overlap for context
      min_segment_duration: 5.0     # Don't create segments shorter than 5 seconds
      preserve_format: true         # Keep original audio format
      sample_rate: null             # Keep original sample rate
      channels: null                # Keep original channel count

# Usage examples:
#
# Basic usage:
#   python -m chunking_strategy.cli chunk audio.mp3 --config config_examples/audio_time_based.yaml
#
# With custom segment duration:
#   python -m chunking_strategy.cli chunk audio.wav --strategy time_based_audio --segment-duration 45.0
#
# Batch processing:
#   python -m chunking_strategy.cli batch audio_folder/ --config config_examples/audio_time_based.yaml
